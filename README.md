# OVCAR-simulations

# Description
The R file contained in this repository enables the computation of Sensititivty Score (DSS) and Volume Under the Surface (VUS) in the context of simulated dose-response data.
The data are simulated from a logistic dose-response curve with added noise and replicates.
Thi setting mimicks the viability assays employed in real-life experiments.
Thsi code can be replicated for different observational settings and can be tuned to accommodate different modelling specifications, as well as experimental settings.
